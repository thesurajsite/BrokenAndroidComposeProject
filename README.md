# Candidate Instructions & Known Bugs (do not change this file name)

This project is intentionally flawed. Your tasks:

1. Fix crashes and freezes
2. Implement navigation to the detail screen
3. Make network calls off the main thread
4. Replace GlobalScope usage with proper ViewModelScope or lifecycle-aware scope
5. Implement local persistence (Room) and use it as cache
6. Correct JSON parsing / DTO mapping
7. Add loading/error/empty states properly
8. Remove memory leak (do not use static Activity references)
9. Implement updateArticle to persist edits
10. Improve project structure where obvious (move business logic out of composables)


Deliverables:
- Working app (no crashes) that loads articles (from the fake API or a real one)
- README describing changes and tradeoffs
- Optional: unit tests and small demo video


Notes:
- Some code intentionally causes the app to freeze or crash. Find and fix them.
- We expect you to explain each bug and your fix in the README.
